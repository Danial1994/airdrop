Prerequisites: Enrollment dApp
(NOTE-If you are a windows user, you will want to work in WSL2 for Solana)
You have 24 hours to complete this.
These prerequisites are meant to assess your ability to follow processes, execute tasks, debug
simple errors (intentionally placed), and ship code. They are not a test of your typescript or
coding skills. It is integral that you UNDERSTAND what is happening every step of the way. This
is a foundational process that we jump right into building upon in week one of the cohort. As
always, when in doubt- after trying for a minute- ask in the Solana Chat channel of the Discord.
If this is beyond your capacity at the moment, we will help you find the right program to better
prepare you for a future cohort.
Now we start- you will:
● Learn how to use @solana/web3.js to create a new keypair
● Use our Public Key to airdrop ourselves some Solana devnet tokens
● Make Solana transfers on devnet
● Empty your devnet wallet into your Turbin3 wallet
● Use our Turbin3 Private Key to enroll in the Turbin3 enrollment dApp
Prerequisites:
Have NodeJS installed
Have yarn installed
Have a fresh folder created to follow this tutorial and all future tutorials
